#Foundational practice

This repository contains small foundational exercises, homework tasks, and micro experiments created to strengthen core programming fundamentals.

#Purpose
1. Master basic syntax across languages
2. Practice small isolated concepts
3. Experiment with tools and environments
4. Track early learning progress

#What belongs here

-Very small exercises (typically under 100 lines)

-Syntax drills

-Basic data structure practice

-Tool experiments (Git, Bash, CLI basics, etc.)

#Philosophy

This repository focuses on depth over complexity.

The goal is not to build large applications, but to build strong foundations.

First level in my structured engineering growth roadmap.
