# Foundational practice

This repository contains small foundational exercises, homework tasks, and micro experiments created to strengthen core programming fundamentals.

## Purpose
- Master **basic syntax** across languages
- Practice **small isolated concepts**
- Experiment with **tools and environments**
- Track early **learning progress**

## What belongs here

- Very small exercises (typically under 100 lines)  
- Syntax drills  
- Basic data structure practice  
- Tool experiments (Git, Bash, CLI basics, etc.)

## Philosophy

This repository focuses on depth over complexity.  
The goal is not to build large applications, but to build strong foundations.  
**First level** in my structured engineering growth roadmap.
